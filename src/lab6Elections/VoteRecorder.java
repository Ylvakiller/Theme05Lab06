/**
 * Holds the names for the candidates for both president and vice-president
 * Records the total amount of votes
 * Allows the names for candidates to be changed, but only when the number of votes is 0 for all candidates
 * Allows the votes to be reset. 
 * Can return the standings for the election
 * 
 * The total amount of votes are stored in BigInteger types to allow more then 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 votes. (maximum size of a long data type)
 * Okay there are only around 7,000,000,000 people on the planet so each person would have to vote at least 1.3 billion times for it to reach the maximum value of long.
 * However I feel that it is better to be safe then sorry, imagine if I would have used an int data type...
 * Then there would be only 2 billion votes possible for one candidate, even with our current global population that would mean that around 1/3 people could vote.
 * Imagine a system like this needing to be used in the far future when the population of humans spans between planets...
 * 
 * As I said, you do not need to use BigIntegers however it is better to be save then sorry,
 * Especially since BigIntegers are basically int[] that are calculated into 1 big number so it allocates enough memory but only as much as it needs.
 * For all values of votes below Int.Maxvalue() it will only allocate the amount of bytes an int data type has,
 * So in that range it is more memory efficient then a long data type.
 * 
 * Records the vote for a specific voter
